The original version of Handler included a forwarder:
```
   mfwd :: forall m sig . Monad m
         => (forall x . Effs sig m x -> m x)
         -> (forall x . Effs sig (t m) x -> t m x)
```
This was replaced by the `Forward` class, which works with families,
since it is too onerous forward every form of signature.

An alternative design would be for the forwarding function to be
provided when the handler is constructed, by the `Forward` class.
However, this means that the family of values that can be
forwarded is then exposed at the type level of the handler type:
```
  data Handler' effs oeffs t fs feffs
```
where `feffs` is the family of effects that can be forwarded, and then we would
need constraints such as `Forward feffs t` to be in place. The advantage
is that custom effects can forward more flexibly, but at the cost
of added complexity in the signature.
That complexity could be hidden by another datatype, much
in the same way as `Handler` obscures the underlying `t` type.

Another design, which was previously implemented
is to have families explicit in the handler signature.
A list of such families would indicate those that can be handled.
If `h1 :: Handler eff1 t1 fam1`, and `h2 :: Handler eff2 t2 fam2`, then the two
can be composed so long as `fam1 âŠ‡ fam2`. All of `eff1` will be
dealt with into carrier the `t1` carrier, and need not concern `h2`,
so long as the carrier is compatible with `eff2`. However, if `eff2` contains a
family of effects that is not recognised by `h1`, then it is
impossible to forward those effects and fusion is impossible.

Yet another design is to use a handler of the form:
```
type Handler
  :: [Effect]                          -- effs  : input effects
  -> [Effect]                          -- oeffs : output effects
  -> [Type -> Type]                    -- f     : carrier type
  -> Type
data Handler effs oeffs fs
  =  forall t . (MonadTrans t
              -- Forward effs t
                )
  => Handler (Handler' effs oeffs t fs)
```
This is a wrapper around a handler that involves a transformer
held as an existential held in some unexposed variable `t`.
The problem with this a approach is that handlers can no longer
fuse easily, since fusion requires a `Forward` constraint
that mentions `t` explicitly.

The closest `fuse` using this interface is:
```
fuse
  :: forall effs1 effs2 oeffs1 oeffs2 fs1 fs2 oeffs1' .
  ( Functor (RComps fs1), RSplit fs2
  , Append effs1 (effs2 :\\ effs1),  Append (oeffs1 :\\ effs2) effs2
  , Injects oeffs2 ((oeffs1 :\\ effs2) :++ (oeffs2 :\\ (oeffs1 :\\ effs2)))
  , Injects oeffs1 ((oeffs1 :\\ effs2) :++ effs2)
  , Injects (oeffs1 :\\ effs2)    ((oeffs1 :\\ effs2) :++ (oeffs2 :\\ (oeffs1 :\\ effs2)))
  , Injects (effs2 :\\ effs1) effs2
  , oeffs1' ~ oeffs1 :\\ effs2
  , forall t . MonadTrans t => Forward effs2 t
  , forall t . MonadTrans t => Forward oeffs1' t
  )
  => Handler effs1 oeffs1 fs2
  -> Handler effs2 oeffs2 fs1
  -> Handler (effs1 :++ (effs2 :\\ effs1))
             ((oeffs1 :\\ effs2) :++ (oeffs2 :\\ (oeffs1 :\\ effs2)))
             (fs2 :++ fs1)
fuse (Handler h1) (Handler h2) = Handler (fuse' h1 h2)
```
This uses `Forward` constraints that work regardless of `t`,
that is, `forall t . MonadTrans t => Forward effs2 t`. While this is definable
for algebraic effects, it is not possible for all scoped effects.

{-

Fusing handlers `h1 :: Handler effs1 oeffs1 t1 fs1` and `h2 :: Handler effs2
oeffs2 t2 fs2` results in a handler that can deal with the effects of `eff1` and
those of `eff2`, as well as appropriately deal with effects `oeff1` that get
output by the first handler.

A handler consists of `malg`, which deals with all the operations in the
syntax tree that the handler will be applied to, and `run`, which
turns the final transformed monad into a functor.

The task of of the `malg` algebra is to interpret the union of `effs1` and
`effs2`. To do so, it must appropriately use the output algebra `oalg` that it
is given, which is responsible for handling any effects that the handler
may produce. The effects in `oeffs1` are produced by `h1`, and
the effects in `oeffs2` are produced by `h2`. If an effect `oeff1` is in
`effs2`, then it means that it is produced by `h1` and can be consumed by `h2`.
To do so, `malg2` is used. Any other effect produced by `h1` will not
be recognised by `h2`, and must therefore be forwarded into the `t2`
transformer as outlined by the `fwd @(oeffs1 :\\ effs2) t2` function.

Effects

means that any syntax of `eff2` must be forwarded by the
transformer `t1` of `h1`, since the effect must bypass `eff1` into syntax in the
context given by `t1`, ready to be consumed by the second handler.  This is
captured by the `Forward eff2 t1` constraint.

Another aspect is that

When the effect is from `effs2`, the `malg2` handler must
of course play a part. The problem is that the
carrier that is targeted is `t ~ TCompose t1 t2`,
whereas `malg` can only work for `t2` carriers.
This makes sense, since the operations in `effs2` must operate
only after `h1` has done its work on the syntax tree. 
To make use of `malg` operate with the `t1` carrier,
