Module      : Control.Monad.Trans.CRes
Description : Resumption monad transformer for concurrency
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

This module contains a special case of the resumption monad from "Control.Monad.Trans.CRes"
with the step functor being @x ↦ 1 + (x × x) + (a × x)@ for a type @a@ of actions. This
is used for modelling concurrency.
