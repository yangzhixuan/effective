Module      : Control.Monad.Trans.YRes
Description : Resumption monad transformer for yield-based coroutine
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

This module contains a special case of the resumption monad from "Control.Monad.Trans.CRes"
with the step functor being @x ↦  a × (b -> x)@ for types @a@ and @b@. This
is used for modelling yield-based coroutines.

-- | The monad @CResT m@ is the coproduct of the monad @m@ and the free monad

-- is the sum of the theory of @m@ plus an operation that takes in an @a@ value
-- and produces a @b@-value.
