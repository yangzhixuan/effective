Module      : Control.Effect.Clone
Description : Making copies of an existing effect
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

This module provides an \'imitater\' effect that clones an existing effect. 
Currently the functionality of this module is very limited: you can only make
one copy of an effect each time, and there is no way to copy an existing 
smart constructor.
