{-
Idea:

Nondeterminism consists of just or and stop.
A model of this is lists, using the list monad transformer.

If we want a notion of backtracking, we must include
a new operation, like `try`, which can be interpreted
as executing `once`, many times etc.

One way to interpret `once` is into the list monad directly.
An alternative is to interpet `once` into `cutFail` and `cutCall`,
which can then be interpreted using a `CutList`.
