Module      : Control.Effect.Cut
Description : Nondeterminism with a cut operation
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Nicolas Wu
Stability   : experimental

This module provides an effect for nondeterminism with a cut operation.
The cut operation allows for pruning the search space in nondeterministic computations.

{-
Idea:

Nondeterminism consists of just or and stop.
A model of this is lists, using the list monad transformer.

If we want a notion of backtracking, we must include
a new operation, like `try`, which can be interpreted
as executing `once`, many times etc.

One way to interpret `once` is into the list monad directly.
An alternative is to interpet `once` into `cutFail` and `cutCall`,
which can then be interpreted using a `CutList`.
