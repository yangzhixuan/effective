Module      : Control.Effect.CodeGen.JoinFlow
Description : Join code-generation branches
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

When using the code-generation effect in meta-programs, we frequently use functions from
"Control.Effect.CodeGen.Split" to split code generation into different branches. Clearly,
splitting too much would lead to blow up of code size. One simple fix is to use the `reset`
operation from "Control.Effect.CodeGen.Up", which binds the current result of code generation
to a let-binding and restart code-generation again (with a single generation branch).

A small flaw of this solution is that it forces all previous generation branches
to share a single \'join point\', and this sometimes forces us to generate
unnecessary wrapping and unwrapping. For example, imagine we have many
code-generation branches, and some of them return values of type @a@ and
all others return values of type @b@.
If we have only one join point, the shared join point has to receive a value of
type @Either a b@, and we need to insert @Left@ and @Right@ in all branches
to invoke this shared join point. However, there is no reason we can have only
one single join point, we should just generate two joint points (using
let-bindings), one receiving @a@-values and the other receiving @b@-values.

This module provides an operation `joinFlow` to do this automatically. This
technique in this module is described in Section 3.5 of Andras Kovacs's [ICFP
2024 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3674648), where the operation is
called @join@.
