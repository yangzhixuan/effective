Description : Algebra transformers for staging concurrency
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

This module contains algebra transformers for `ResUpT`, the monad transformer to be
used at the meta level for resumption. The monad transformer `ResUpT` can be downed 
to and upped from the (object-level) resumption monad transformer @ResT@.
Moreover, for every functor @s@, the monad `ResUpT s n` supports algebraic 
operations of signature @s@ the same way as @ResT s@.

However, we also have operations on @ResT s m@ that are defined by pattern matching
and recursion, such as @parL@ in "Control.Monad.Trans.CResT". These operations can't
be implemented on @ResUpT@ because @ResUpT@ doesn't support pattern matching.

An imperfect workaround is to have /restricted version/ of these operations at the meta
level, such as @`parUp` :: m (Up x) -> m (Up x) -> m (Up x)@ where the return value 
must be code, and `ResUpT` supports operations like this by downing 
the arguments to the object level and invoke the object-level algebra, and then up
the result back to the meta level. This is of course very unsatisfactory but currently
I don't know how to do better.
